"@PhoneSupport My phone’s battery life has been awful ever since the latest update 😩. Any idea when this will be fixed? It’s barely lasting a few hours now, even when I’m not using it that much. I’ve tried everything from turning off background apps, reducing screen brightness, and even putting it in power-saving mode, but nothing seems to help. Is this a known issue with the update?"
User complains about significant battery drain after the latest software update and seeks help from @PhoneSupport. They describe the issue in detail, explaining that even after trying multiple troubleshooting steps—such as turning off background apps, lowering brightness, and using power-saving mode—the battery continues to drain excessively. The user asks if the issue is related to the update and whether there is a fix available.
"Also, the battery percentage drops really fast, even when the phone is idle. It wasn’t like this before the update, so I’m thinking it’s software-related. Should I expect a fix in the next patch, or do I need to take it to a service center? I’m really hoping for a solution because this is making my phone unusable for a full day without charging."
The user elaborates that the issue seems to occur even when the phone is idle, suggesting it might be a software-related problem introduced by the recent update. They inquire whether a future patch will address the issue or if they should visit a service center for repairs. The frustration is evident, as the user emphasizes that the phone is no longer able to last an entire day without charging.
